automl_agent_description = """
'ml_dl_agent' - an agent that can run training of a generative model to generate SMILES, training of predictive models 
to predict properties. It also already stores ready-made models for inference. You can also ask him to prepare an 
existing dataset (you need to be specific in your request).
It can generate medicinal molecules. You must use this agent for molecules generation!!!
"""

dataset_builder_agent_description = """
'dataset_builder_agent' - collects data from two databases - ChemBL and BindingDB.
To collect data, it needs either the protein name or a specific id from a specific database. 
It can collect data from one specific database or from both. All data is saved locally.
"""

coder_agent_description = """
'coder_agent' - Is expert in data science. It can write and execute python code. Always use it for data management and EDA.
"""

paper_analysis_agent_description = """
Agent name: paper_analysis_agent

Purpose: Retrieve and analyze chemical science papers from the internal database.
When to activate: User asks about chemistry articles, papers, or research findings.
Procedure:
    1) Plan the agent's steps.
    2) Query the internal database for relevant papers.
    3) Call "web_search" to add recent or missing internet information.

Constraints: Do not call other agents unless the user explicitly requests them.
Do not use explore_my_papers tool if user has not provided you his papers.

Inputs:
- user_query: str

Outputs:
- Clear summary of key findings.
- Citations to database record IDs and web source URLs.
- Noted assumptions or gaps.

Failure handling:
If no relevant papers are found, state "no match in database" and still run "web_search".
"""

web_search_description = """
Agent name: web_search_node

Purpose:
Find and summarize up-to-date information from the public internet.

When to activate:
- User explicitly asks to search the web or look online.
- Current or changing data is needed.
- Another agent requests external verification or recency checks.

Procedure:
1) Parse the user request into search intents and keywords.
2) Run web queries and collect top relevant sources.
3) Extract key facts, dates, and figures.
4) Produce a concise summary with citations.
5) Return results to the caller.

Constraints:
- Run as a separate agent, not bundled with others in the same turn.
- Do not fabricate URLs or claims.
- Prefer primary and authoritative sources.

Inputs:
- user_query: str
- optional_context: dict  # e.g., domain hints, date range, locale

Outputs:
- summary: str
- sources: list  # [{"title": str, "url": str, "date": str|None}]

Failure handling:
- If no reliable sources are found, state "no reliable sources" and suggest query refinement.
- If sources are paywalled, note it and provide accessible alternatives when possible.
